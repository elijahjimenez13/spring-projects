1) Output: What the user recieves from the program / computer as a response to their input (this is used in code when you want to show the user the data of the program on the screen as prinouts or signals)

2) Variable:  A value that can change depending on conditions or infoormation paced through program. (this is used in code to store information and to be used later)

3) Conditional (if/else): conpares values with a condition to find if something is true or false (this is used in code when you want to have a response from a variable depending on the value)

4) Boolean (data type): a variable that can only have 2 values of true or false (this is used in code when you want the system to change depending on if a certain condition is true or false (or Var))

5) Indentation: important in python because it indicates a block of code and is better to use tab for (this is used in code especially in python because it is important to show what is embedded within the if statement or function)

6) Pre-defined functions (quit(), lower()): Built into the software and does not need to be created by a programmer (this is used in code when you need to execute something such as ignoring capitalization)

7) Arithmetic Assignment Operators (+=): different signs that are used in code to equal or add to variables

8) Order of precedence, ->: this is important to know in code because there is a order to what the math is done (PEMDAS)
