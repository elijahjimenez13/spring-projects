1) Variables: A value that can change depending on conditions or infoormation paced through program. this is used to give values to an object to store and exchange the information.

2) Lists: used to store multiple items in a single variable and this was useful to store a list of characters to take from and allow for words to be stored within one object.

3) Boolean Logic (AND, OR, etc.): used to represent the truth value of an expression and usually used true or false.

4) While Loops: used to run a block code until a certain condition is met and this was used when it was needed to repeat code until a certain condition was met to run the program.

5) Conditional (if/else if/ else): uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. this was used to start a if statement. 

6) Optimization (clean code up and add functions): the goal of optimization is to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions (including maximum and minimums)
