1) Function: a block of code which only runs when it is called. this was used in def computer_guess(x): where I called upon it with computer_guess(10)

2) Function Parameters: variables that are defined in the function definition. this was used in def computer_guess(x): (x being the function parameter)

3) Function Arguments:  the value that are sent to the function when it is called. this was used in computer_guess(10) ((10) being the function arguement)

4) Random Module (library): an in-built module of Python which is used to generate random numbers. this was used when we needed a random number to be generated so the game could function.

5) While loop: used to run a block code until a certain condition is met and this was useful in this project because it allowed for the program to run until the goal was met (condition was met)

6) Boolean (data Type): used to represent the truth value of an expression. this wasn't really used in this code but in a sense it is similar to a conditions that were used that asked whether it was greater than or less than.

7) Indentation: this is an important aspect within python because it shows what is nested within one another. this was used when this code used if statements to show that the things were nested within the if statement.

8) Conditionals (if/else if): uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. this was used to start a if statement. 

9) Abstraction: a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. this is important so the user doesn't have too much information flow out towards them and they don't understand most of it.
