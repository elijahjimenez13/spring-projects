1) Pull data from files (open file): if you want to read a text file in Python, you first have to open it as well as close it. this was used in this project to look through a password txt file so it can print all passwords for user.

2) While Loops: used to run a block code until a certain condition is met and this was used in this code to run a certain section of code when the condition of the while loop was met, running the program.

3) Conditional (if/else if/ else): uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. this was used in this project to determine the input of the user so the program could respond accordingly.

4) Optimization (clean code up and add functions): the goal of optimization is to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions (including maximum and minimums)
