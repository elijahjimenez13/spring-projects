KEY CONCEPTS (How they are used (definition is not required))

1) Output: What the user recieves from the program / computer as a response to their input (this is used in code when you want to show the user the data of the program on the screen as prinouts or signals)

2) String (data Type): A sequence of character used to represent text (this is used in almost every single piece of code because it allows faster access to sequences of characters and is useful for outputting)

3) String Literal: A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes like 'Hello World' (NOT IN VARIABLES) (this is used in code to declare variables because it can add a string to a var)

4) String Concatenation (different ways):  how the strings are put together which can be + operator because it puts strings together. (this is used in code when you want output multiple different strings and variables on the same line)

5) FString: Define f string is used to format strings and is used to make it easier because there isn't a need to use a + operator in f strings. (this is used in code when you want to make code more condensed without concatenation)

6) Variables: A value that can change depending on conditions or infoormation paced through program. (this is used in code to store information and to be used later)

7) Input: What is asked or asking user to put into the program / console (this is used in code to ask wait for responses from the user)

8) Comments: Notes used to understand concepts and for fellow coworkers to understand code. (this is used in code to help with understanding what the code is doing)
