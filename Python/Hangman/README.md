1) JSON: a syntax for storing and exchanging data. it is used with python and hangman code is a great example because it used JSON t/o the whole code including the variable (word_letters)

2) Abstraction: a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. this is important so the user doesn't have too much information flow out towards them and they don't understand most of it.

3) File import: this has a command that allows for importing files instead of having to duplicate them (not used in this project)

4) Methods (random.choice, string.ascii_uppercase, etc.): a function that “belongs to” an object and this usually codes for certain tasks and is built-in.

5) While loops:  used to run a block code until a certain condition is met and this was useful in this project because it allowed for the program to run until the goal was met (condition was met)

6) Nested Conditions: condition statements within other condition statements and this was useful because this code was able to determine how to take action on a given character depending on the conditions that it passes.

7) Lists: used to store multiple items in a single variable and this was useful to store a list of characters to take from and allow for words to be built upon.

8) User-defined functions: Functions that we define ourselves to do certain specific task are referred as user-defined functions. The way in which we define and call functions in Python are already discussed. This was used so we could avoid the built-in functions for a more unique and personalized function that would carry out what we needed in this code.

9) Void Functions vs. return: Void functions are created and used just like value-returning functions except they do not return a value after the function executes. there is a big difference between these two because at times you need to return a value that you want to then use in another function.
